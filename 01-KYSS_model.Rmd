# The KYSS-model

The theoretical framework on soft skills was developed during the KYSS-project [7]. In this project a literature review inventoried soft skills incorporated in existing soft skill-models. Subsequently, the top 25 of most frequently mentioned soft skills were prioritised by stakeholders in both the institute for higher education and the labour market. This resulted in a model of 16 soft skills organised in four overarching domains. These soft skills were deemed relevant for higher education and the workplace. *Figure 1* provides a schematic overview of the structure of the model, while *Table 1* contains a short description of the incorporated soft skills.
